# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you have read and understand the **Motivation** section to be aligned with the project goals.
2. Before submitting a PR please make a comment in the relevant issue to inform maintainers that you would like to work on it.
3. If this is something new and there is no issue asociated with the PR you would want to create it first using either "Feature Request" or "Bug Report" template.
4. All workflow scripts (like prettier, linter, tests) have to pass successfully. They are run on a CI server by `npm run ci-check` script.
5. Code coverage should not decline both in terms of type and runtime unit tests.
